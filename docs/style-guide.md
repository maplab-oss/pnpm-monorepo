# TypeScript Coding Guidelines

These guidelines optimize for clarity, minimal concepts, and low cognitive load. We favor few strict rules, followed consistently.

---

## 2. Files & Exports

* One primary function per file
  * Exceptions: simple lists, pure data maps, or trivial wrappers
* Use `export const` exclusively
  * No `export default`
  * Enforces consistent naming and imports
* Files are named directly after the thing they export
  * No suffixes like `.model.ts`, `.service.ts`, etc.
* All imports must be declared at the top of the file except for intentional circular-dependency or platform guards

---

## 3. Function Size & Complexity

* Functions should generally:
  * Fit in one editor view (~60 lines max)
  * Do one logical thing
* Measure by complexity, not line count
  * A 100-line switch is fine
  * A few nested loops/conditionals is already "too complex"
* Avoid:
  * Deep nesting
  * Defining functions inside functions (except when strictly required, e.g. hooks)

Small functions force good decomposition and natural modularity.

---

## 4. Code Organization

* Organize by feature/slice, not by type
  * Avoid generic folders like `utils`, `services`, `components` at the top level
* Co-locate related logic:
  * If a component is only used by its parent, it lives with its parent
* Only introduce deeper folder structure when a folder becomes meaningfully large (≈10+ files)
* The folder structure should "scream" what the system does at a glance and the filetree should echo the real structure of your program

> Some exceptions can be made for super ubiqtuitous conventions and tools like NextJS and shadcn/ui patterns.

### Component Folders

For big components, use a folder structure with `index.ts`:

```
/SomeComponent
  index.ts        // export { SomeComponent } from "./SomeComponent"
  SomeComponent.tsx    // the actual component
```

---

## 5. Naming

* Names should be:
  * As long as necessary
  * No longer than needed
* Never repeat obvious context
  * Directory and module already provide most of the meaning
* Functions are always verbs
  * `openModal`, `updateName`, `fetchUser`
  * Avoid: `onClick`, `handleChange`
* Avoid vague prefixes like `handle`, `manage`

### Booleans

* Use `is`, `has`, `can`, `will` only when short and clarifying
  * `isOpen`, `hasAccess` ✅
  * Overly long grammatical constructions ❌

---

## 6. Constants

Reserve ALL_CAPS for true real-world invariants like `PI`, `SECONDS_PER_DAY`. Everything else follows normal naming rules.

---

## 7. React-Specific Conventions

* Treat React components as just functions
* Handler naming:
  * Name by what they do, not how they’re triggered
  * Prefer: `updateName`, `openDialog`
  * Avoid: `onClickName`, `handleChange`
* If `setX` already exists:
  * Use a verb like `updateX` for richer logic
* Controlled components:
  * Props reflect behavior, not wiring (`value`, `onChange` as behavior, not "handlers")
